AIM: Simulate Simple BSS with trnsmitting nodes in wireless LAn by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets

1. Create Project
Start a new project in the simulator (e.g., OPNET/NS2/NS3).

Set unit to meters for correct wireless range.

2. Add Wireless Nodes
    Open Object Palette → Select wireless_lan_adv.

    Add 4 × wlan_station_adv (fix) nodes to the workspace.

3. Configure Application Traffic
    Draw a Topology -> Annotation Palatte -> circle annotation around all 4 nodes to mark the network region.

    Select one node → Right-click → Select Similar Nodes → Edit Attributes:

    Traffic Generation Parameters :
                                    Start Time: constant(1)
                                    ON State: constant(100)
                                    OFF State: constant(0)

    Packet Generation Arguments:
                                   Interarrival Time: exponential(1)

    Click Apply Changes → OK.

4. Enable Statistics
   Right-click on workspace → Choose Individual Statistics -> Node Statistics

  Under Wireless LAN :
                      Data Traffic Sent (packets/sec)
                      Data Traffic Received (packets/sec)

5. Run Simulation
            Click Run Simulation icon.
            Set Simulation Duration: 100 seconds
            Click Run

6. View Results
    Right-click → View Results

Change view to: Sample_Sum or Average

7. Result Interpretation:
  Each node sends ~1 packet/sec

  Each node receives ~2.5 packets/sec

  Because it gets packets from 3 other nodes.

  Some packet loss may be seen (can be analyzed further using bit/sec stats
